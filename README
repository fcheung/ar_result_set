ArResultSet
===========

Testing ground for introducing a result-set proxy to ActiveRecord and then doing cool stuff with it.

If you are using Rails 2.1, then do not use in combination with has_one :through associations as a bug in preloading these associations will cause infinite recursion (fixed in http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/b7a37b742c0abd1df8ea48cc82f76385cc0c41ea)

Some types of associations produce unreliable results when eager loaded (eg has_many with limits) and so may produce undefined results. In the case of has_many with limits the plugin enforces this (ie lets the normal rails code run)
