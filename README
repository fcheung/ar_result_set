ArResultSet
===========

Testing ground for introducing a result-set proxy to ActiveRecord and then doing cool stuff with it.

If you are using Rails 2.1, then do not use in combination with has_one :through associations as a bug in preloading these associations will cause infinite recursion (fixed in http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/b7a37b742c0abd1df8ea48cc82f76385cc0c41ea)

Some types of associations produce unreliable results when eager loaded (eg has_many with limits) and so may produce undefined results. In the case of has_many with limits the plugin enforces this (ie lets the normal rails code run)

The Fun Stuff
=============

You find calls look the same, but they now return a proxy object. Right now this allows you todo

users = User.find :all, ...
users.load {:projects => :milestones}

to eager load a users projects and the milestones from that project.

Better still:

doing users[0].projects will guess that you want to access projects for everyone and go ahead and load that

and users[0].projects[0].milestones would load all milestones for all projects for all of the users.

When a find is done a record tracks the result set it was part of via its result_set variable. This has obvious garbage collection
implications which have been completely ignored.
